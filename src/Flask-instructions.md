# Notes when running Flask app
> **Important Note:**  
> Please connect to the `Dev Container` first before any development

- To run the app, inside the terminal:
    1. Navigate to the `src` directory by running `cd src/`
    2. Run `export FLASK_DEBUG=1` to set the mode as debug
    3. Run `flask run`
- To open the app,
    1. Navigate to webpage using proper URL inside a browser, for exmaple, the URL could be `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` when accessing the main page of the app if testing locally
        - Alternatively, if developing using *VSCode*, there will be a pop-up on the bottom right saying that our application is avaliable. Click `Open in Browser` to open the web app
- To close the running server, press `CTRL+C` inside the terminal
